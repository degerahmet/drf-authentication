Getting started
===============

Requirements
------------

* Python (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
* Django (2.2, 3.1, 3.2)
* Django REST Framework (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)

These are the officially supported python and package versions.  Other versions
will probably work.  You're free to modify the tox config and see what is
possible.

Installation
------------

Django Rest Framework Authentication can be installed with pip::

  ``pip install drf-auth-simple``
